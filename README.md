Energy Minimization Algorithm for Optimal Traffic Light Coordination

This code displays the behavior of vehicles in front of different traffic light coordination patterns. 
Different traffic light offfsets are used and the vehicle behavior is studied through a simulation in order to determine the offset that allows cars to get to their final destination using the least amount of energy.
